    "To keep this project focused, I am breaking this project into 5 steps based on Faraz Mubeen's article on Medium.com from July 2023. In the ['*6 Steps of any data anlytics project*'](https://medium.com/@farazmubeen902/6-steps-of-any-data-analytics-project-bde8d8072f89), he describes the \"six fundamental steps involved in any data analytics project\". These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask** - *Formulating the right questions*\n",
    "2. **Prepare** - *Collecting and organising relevant data*\n",
    "3. **Process** - *Cleaning and preparing data for analysis*\n",
    "4. **Analyse** - *Uncovering patterns and insights*\n",
    "5. **Share** - *Communicating insights through data visualisations*\n",
    "6. **Act** - *Translating insights into actionable plans*\n",
    "\n",
    "As the \"**Ask**\" has already been set by the assignment, I will be following a modified set of steps - *Prepare*, *Process*, *Analyse*, **Predict** and *Share*. "
